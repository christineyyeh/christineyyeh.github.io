Bio
======

I am a 2nd year student in a dual degree MD/PhD program at Stanford, with my PhD specifically in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/dbds/education/biomedical-informatics-graduate-program.html). I am co-advised by Drs. [Sylvia Plevritis](https://med.stanford.edu/plevritis.html) and [Livnat Jerby](https://ray-point-e4nb.squarespace.com/). My current work is focused on developing machine-learning based approaches to deconvolve highly multiplexed molecular and image data for studying cancer progression.

Before returning to graduate/medical school, I worked as a Computational Biologist at [D. E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/). There, I (1) developed computational methods for accelerating the discovery of targeted small-molecule drugs for diabetes and oncology indications, including [RLY-1971](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04252339), and (2) researched the structure, function, and dynamics of protein targets implicated in complex diseases using molecular dynamics simulations. 

As an undergraduate and masters student at Stanford, I was co-advised by Drs. [Michael Snyder](https://med.stanford.edu/snyderlab.html) and [Sharon Pitteri](https://med.stanford.edu/pitterilab.html), investigating the longitudinal proteogenomic landscape of health and disease.

Something Extra
======

I hail from the beautiful island of Taiwan and identify as Hoklo-Hakka-Taiwanese (ask me about this!). When I am not wrangling massive amounts of biological data or palpating spleens, you can find me driving intitatives for the advancement of [underrepresented minorities](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi/prospective-students/PhD-degree-biomedical-informatics.html), women, and [international students](https://www.f1doctor.com/mentors-2-0/christine-yiwen-yeh) in science and medicine, or [slinging mud in the ceramics studio](https://www.instagram.com/clay.by.christine/).
