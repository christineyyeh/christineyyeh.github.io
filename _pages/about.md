Bio
======

I am a 2nd year student in a dual degree MD/PhD program at Stanford, with my PhD specifically in Biomedical Informatics. I am co-advised by Drs. Sylvia Plevritis and Livnat Jerby. My current work is focused on developing machine-learning based approaches to deconvolve highly multiplexed molecular and image data for studying cancer progression.

Before returning to graduate/medical school, I worked as a Computational Biologist at D. E. Shaw Research. There, I (1) developed computational methods for accelerating the discovery of targeted small-molecule drugs for diabetes and oncology indications, including RLY-1971, and (2) researched the structure, function, and dynamics of protein targets implicated in complex diseases using molecular dynamics simulations. 

As an undergraduate and masters student at Stanford, I was co-advised by Drs. Michael Snyder and Sharon Pitteri, investigating the longitudinal  proteogenomic landscape of health and disease.

Not Science
======

I hail from the beautiful island of Taiwan and identify as Hoklo-Hakka-Taiwanese (ask me about this!). When I am not wrangling massive amounts of biological data or palpating spleens, you can find me in the ceramics studio, or driving intitatives to amplify voices of underrepresented minorities, women, and international students in science and medicine.
