From 2017-2020, I volunteered as a Saturday teacher through the organization Apex for Youth, a non-profit organization that supports underserved Asian and immigrant youth from low-income families in New York City. Every Saturday I taught Reading and Math to a group of 4th-graders in public school in  Manhattan's Chinatown to help underresourced children prepare for the highly competitve NY state exams for entrance into public middle schools. 

Course Information
------

Apex for Youth's Elementary Program helps 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students prepare academically for the ELA and Math NY state exams in April. Volunteers work with provided lessons and a small group of students. In addition, students also participate in social-emotional activities (e.g., journaling and storytime), project-based learning, public speaking practice, and other creative projects.
