I was a TA for the course BIOC205: Molecular Foundations of Medicine, with Professor Gilbert Chu. This course is the first course in the core curriculum for first-year medical students. I led journal club discussion, graded homework, and held course office hours weekly. 

Course Information

For medical students. Topics include DNA structure, replication, repair, and recombination; gene expression, including mechanisms for regulating transcription and translation; chromosome structure and function; gene cloning, protein engineering, and genomics. Patient presentations and journal clubs illustrate how molecular biology affects the practice of medicine.
